# Vendor-Controlled Discount & Coupon System Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive vendor-controlled discount and coupon system, moving away from Admin-level global control to vendor-level autonomy. This allows each vendor to manage their own product discounts and coupon codes independently.

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ **Vendor Discount Types**
- **Percentage Discounts** (e.g., 10% off)
- **Fixed Amount Discounts** (e.g., $50 off)
- **Volume-based Discounts** with quantity tiers (5-9, 10-14, 15+)
- **Product-specific** vs **vendor-wide** discounts
- **Scheduled Discounts** with start/end dates
- **Automatic** vs **manual** discount application

### ‚úÖ **Vendor Coupon System**
- **Coupon Code Management** with unique codes per vendor
- **Usage Limits** (total and per-customer)
- **Customer Targeting** (first-time, existing, customer types)
- **Geographic Restrictions** (allowed/excluded regions)
- **Stackable Options** (with other discounts/coupons)
- **Free Shipping** and **Upgrade** coupons

### ‚úÖ **Multi-Vendor Cart Support**
- **Vendor-specific** discount application
- **Cart breakdown** by vendor with individual discounts
- **Coupon validation** per vendor
- **Automatic discount** calculation
- **Manual coupon** application and removal

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### **Database Schema**
```sql
/migrations/vendor_discount_enhancement.sql
```
- Enhanced `vendor_discounts` table
- New `vendor_coupons` table  
- `vendor_discount_usage` tracking
- `cart_vendor_discounts` for cart application
- Deprecated global discount tables

### **API Endpoints**

#### Vendor Discount Management
```typescript
/app/api/vendor/discounts/route.ts           # CRUD operations
/app/api/vendor/discounts/[id]/route.ts      # Individual discount management  
/app/api/vendor/discounts/bulk/route.ts      # Bulk operations
```

#### Vendor Coupon Management
```typescript
/app/api/vendor/coupons/route.ts             # CRUD operations
/app/api/vendor/coupons/validate/route.ts    # Coupon validation
```

#### Cart Integration
```typescript
/app/api/cart/vendor-discounts/route.ts      # Automatic discount calculation
/app/api/cart/apply-coupon/route.ts          # Coupon application/removal
```

### **User Interfaces**

#### Vendor Management Interface
```typescript
/app/vendor/discounts/page.tsx               # Main vendor discount management UI
```
- Search and filter capabilities
- Bulk actions (activate, deactivate, duplicate, delete)
- Status tracking (active, inactive, scheduled, expired)
- Analytics dashboard
- Create/edit forms

#### Admin Interface Updates
```typescript
/app/admin/pricing/page.tsx                  # Redirects to commission-only
/app/admin/pricing/commissions/page.tsx      # Commission management only
```

### **Context & State Management**
```typescript
/context/VendorCartContext.tsx               # Multi-vendor cart with discounts
```
- Vendor-specific cart summaries
- Discount and coupon state management
- Real-time price calculations
- Error handling and loading states

## üîß Implementation Details

### **Database Structure**

#### Enhanced Vendor Discounts
```sql
vendor_discounts:
- discount_code (optional for manual codes)
- is_automatic (true for auto-apply, false for manual codes)
- volume_tiers (JSON for tiered pricing)
- stackable_with_coupons
- priority (for conflict resolution)
- terms_conditions
```

#### Vendor Coupons
```sql
vendor_coupons:
- coupon_code (unique globally)
- customer targeting (first_time, existing_only)
- geographic restrictions
- usage limits (total, per_customer)
- stackable options
- scheduling (auto_activate, auto_deactivate)
```

### **Business Logic**

#### Discount Application Priority
1. **Volume discounts** (quantity-based)
2. **Product-specific** discounts
3. **Vendor-wide** discounts
4. **Manual coupon codes**

#### Validation Rules
- Minimum order values
- Customer eligibility
- Usage limits
- Date validity
- Geographic restrictions
- Product applicability

#### Multi-Vendor Cart Logic
```typescript
// Cart structure by vendor
{
  vendor_id: 123,
  vendor_name: "Window Pro",
  items: [...],
  subtotal: 500.00,
  applied_discounts: [...],
  applied_coupons: [...],
  discount_amount: 50.00,
  total: 450.00
}
```
