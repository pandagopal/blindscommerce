# Pricing System Integration - Complete Implementation

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Cart Context Integration** (`/context/CartContext.tsx`)
- Added real-time pricing calculation using the pricing API
- Automatically applies volume discounts based on quantity
- Supports coupon code validation and application
- Tracks customer type for special pricing
- Shows all discount types separately

### 2. **Cart Page Updates** (`/app/cart/page.tsx`)
- Removed hardcoded "SAVE10" discount logic
- Now shows actual discounts from pricing API:
  - Volume discounts
  - Coupon discounts  
  - Campaign/promotional discounts
- Real-time pricing updates when quantities change
- Proper coupon application with error handling

### 3. **Checkout Integration** (`/app/checkout/page.tsx`)
- Uses calculated pricing from cart context
- Passes all discount details to Stripe payment metadata
- Sends complete pricing breakdown to order creation API
- Tracks which promotions were applied

### 4. **Order Creation with Commission** (`/app/api/orders/create/route.ts`)
- Stores vendor ID for commission calculation
- Tracks all discount amounts separately
- Records coupon and campaign usage
- Updates order status to trigger commission calculation
- Increments coupon usage counters

### 5. **Database Schema Updates**
- Added pricing tables: volume_discounts, promotional_campaigns, coupon_codes
- Added commission tables: commission_rules, commission_calculations
- Added vendor discount management tables
- Automated commission triggers on order completion

## How It Works Now

### Customer Flow:
1. **Add to Cart**: Products added with base price
2. **Cart View**: 
   - Volume discounts automatically applied based on quantity
   - Can enter coupon codes which are validated via API
   - Shows breakdown of all discounts
3. **Checkout**: 
   - All pricing carried forward
   - Discount metadata sent to payment processor
4. **Order Creation**:
   - Discount amounts stored in database
   - Commission automatically calculated based on admin-configured rules
   - Coupon usage tracked

### Admin Control:
1. **Global Discounts**: Admin can create site-wide promotional campaigns
2. **Volume Discounts**: Configure quantity-based pricing tiers
3. **Vendor Discounts**: Approve/reject vendor-requested discounts
4. **Commission Rules**: Set commission rates for vendors and sales staff
5. **Coupon Management**: Create and track coupon usage

## Key Features Implemented:

✅ **Real-time Pricing Calculation** - No more hardcoded discounts
✅ **Multiple Discount Types** - Volume, coupon, campaign, customer-specific
✅ **Commission Tracking** - Automatic calculation on order completion
✅ **Admin Control** - All pricing controlled through admin interface
✅ **Vendor Management** - Vendors can request discounts, admin approves
✅ **Usage Tracking** - Track coupon usage, campaign performance
✅ **Proper Integration** - End-to-end from cart to order completion

## Example Pricing Calculation:

```javascript
// When customer has 10 blinds in cart:
{
  subtotal: 1000.00,           // 10 blinds × $100 each
  volume_discount: 100.00,      // 10% volume discount for 10+ items
  coupon_discount: 50.00,       // Additional coupon discount
  campaign_discount: 0.00,      // No active campaign
  total_discount: 150.00,       // Total savings
  shipping: 0.00,               // Free shipping over $100
  tax: 70.13,                   // Tax on discounted amount
  total: 920.13                 // Final amount
}
```

## Commission Example:

When order is completed:
- Vendor receives 15% commission on order (configurable)
- Sales staff receives 5% commission if involved (configurable)
- Commission automatically tracked in database
- Admin can process bulk commission payments

This is now a production-ready pricing system with proper database integration, API endpoints, and UI components all working together.
