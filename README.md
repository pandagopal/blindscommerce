### Usage Guidelines

1. **Consistency**
   - Use colors consistently across the platform
   - Maintain the established color hierarchy
   - Follow accessibility guidelines for text contrast

2. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure sufficient contrast ratios
   - Use appropriate text colors on different backgrounds
   - Consider color-blind users when using status colors

3. **Implementation**
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes with our custom colors
   - Reference colors from the `colors.ts` file for TypeScript projects
   - Follow the established pattern in layouts and components

4. **Brand Identity**
   - Use the primary red color sparingly for impact
   - Maintain professional appearance with supporting colors
   - Keep interfaces clean and uncluttered

### Technical Implementation

Colors are defined in two locations:

1. `app/styles/colors.ts` - TypeScript constants for programmatic usage
2. `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration for utility classes

Example usage with Tailwind:
```tsx
// Text color
<p className="text-[#333333]">Primary text</p>

// Background color
<div className="bg-[#F5F5F5]">Background</div>

// Border color
<div className="border border-[#E5E7EB]">Border</div>

// Hover states
<button className="text-[#D42E12] hover:text-[#1A365D]">
  Hover Effect
</button>
```

  operate as single-vendor retailers. You're positioning yourself more like Amazon for window treatments, which could be a major
  competitive advantage.
