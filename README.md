3. **Implementation**

2. `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration for utility classes

Example usage with Tailwind:
```tsx
// Text color
<p className="text-[#333333]">Primary text</p>

// Background color
<div className="bg-[#F5F5F5]">Background</div>

// Border color
<div className="border border-[#E5E7EB]">Border</div>

// Hover states
<button className="text-[#D42E12] hover:text-[#1A365D]">
